# Mercado Libre (Brazil) – Marketplace Operations & Customer Insights Analysis
**Category:** Marketplace Analytics / Operations Strategy

### **Research Context**

MercadoLibre operates the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, serving millions of customers and sellers across 18 countries. Rapid expansion in Brazil created a complex operating environment where growth outpaced analytical instrumentation, limiting visibility into sales performance, logistics efficiency, marketing effectiveness, and customer experience.
This independent research study examines Brazil’s marketplace operations using large-scale transactional, logistics, review, and marketing data to surface actionable insights relevant to executive and board-level decision-making

### **Research Objective**

The analysis was designed to answer a set of critical questions across three core dimensions: <br> •	Sales Performance: What products, regions, and pricing dynamics are driving revenue growth? <br> •	Operations: How do payments, delivery performance, and fulfillment speed influence customer satisfaction and review outcomes? <br> •	Marketing & Seller Acquisition: Which channels generate the strongest seller leads, and how do they connect to downstream marketplace activity?  

The goal was to move beyond descriptive metrics and uncover structural patterns affecting scalability, efficiency, and customer trust

### **Why This Research Matters**

Marketplace businesses operate at the intersection of sellers, logistics partners, customers, and marketing channels. Small inefficiencies—slow deliveries, misaligned pricing, or ineffective lead sources—can compound rapidly at scale. <br> This research provides a data-backed foundation for: <br> •	Prioritizing operational improvements <br> •	Protecting customer satisfaction during aggressive growth <br> •	Allocating marketing resources more efficiently <br> •	Informing leadership decisions with measurable evidence rather than assumptions

### **Analytical Methodology**

•	Integrated 100k+ marketplace orders with product attributes, payment methods, freight performance, customer locations, and review data <br> •	Analyzed 8k+ marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to assess seller acquisition channels and funnel performance <br> •	Linked sellers across marketing and transaction datasets using relational modeling <br> •	Conducted time-series revenue analysis (monthly and quarterly trends) <br> •	Evaluated relationships between pricing, delivery speed, review volume, and customer ratings <br> •	Standardized financial metrics by converting BRL to USD for executive comparability <br> •	Structured outputs for visualization and board-level reporting

### **Key Findings & Insights**

•	Revenue concentration is driven by a limited number of high-performing product categories, with meaningful geographic variation across Brazilian states <br> •	Higher-priced products do not consistently generate higher customer ratings, challenging common pricing-quality assumptions <br> •	Faster delivery performance is strongly associated with higher review volume and improved customer satisfaction <br> •	Review scores vary significantly by product category and customer location, enabling targeted operational interventions <br> •	Seller acquisition efforts differ substantially by marketing channel, creating opportunities for more efficient funnel optimization


### **Tools & Technologies**

•	SQL for large-scale querying, transformation, and analysis <br> •	AWS RDS for data execution <br> •	Amazon QuickSight for visualization and executive storytelling <br> •	Relational Data Modeling & ER Diagrams <br> •	Marketplace, Operations, and Marketing Analytics

### **Research Outcome**

This study demonstrates how structured analytics can restore operational visibility in fast-scaling digital marketplaces. By connecting sales, logistics, customer sentiment, and marketing performance, the analysis provides a scalable framework for data-driven decision-making in complex platform ecosystems.
